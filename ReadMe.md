This project shows how to use Generative AI to generate prompt that can be in turn used by GitHub Copilot to create Python code to perform the task

## Original prompt entered on OpenAI ChatGPT:
I want to create a prompt for GitHub Copilot to help me write a prompt to scavange a web site (https://docs.molt.bot/) and harvest the links on the page and save the hyperlinks to a file called "links.txt". Help me write the prompt that is precise and spec driven

## Then I continued with the following prompt modification:

I mainly want the links from the navigation pane on the left and I want to remove duplicate

## Finally
I saved the result as "ChatGPTPrompts.md" in VS Code. With the file open, I asked GitHub Copilot Agent mode to "execute the prompt in the open file.
